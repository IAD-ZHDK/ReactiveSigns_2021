# Sheep Invasion

This project belongs to Mo BÃ¼nzli and Carina Good.

## How the poster works
 
!!! You have to go into fullscreen with the browser. Not with the Javascript function to make the poster fullscreen.

The browser is caching the background image for performance eventhough the size of the screen changed.

1. Go into fullscreen over the browser menu.
2. Reload poster.

The poster starts as soon as the position of the cursor changes.
The sheep start to eat the grass based on the cursors position.
When the sheep finished the only walk around. Here could the next poster apear.

There are maybe some improvments happening over the holidays ;)
