A reactive poster that creates an anamorphosis out of THIS NEVER HAPPENED (left) and EVEN THIS HAPPENED (right) based on the observer's position. It is visualized through a three dimensional rendering of the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin.

The three main states are: 1. THIS NEVER HAPPENED, 2. default state, 3. EVEN THIS HAPPENED.

The project is in its final stage and ready to use. Tested on notebook and museum sized screens with VSCode, Processing and Chrome. No errors are known to this stage.

Flickering animation has been turned off by default. For toggling the flickering animation set the parameter to true at the end of the AnimationManager initializer in sketch.js (line 19).

What could be improved: Implement the Blender model directly into p5 for smoother animations.

Older versions of OSC_Control.js and Poster_Control.js are being used, the state of tracking feature is therefore not implemented.
