[Summary]
The code works well on a small computer screen when working with a mouse, but on the big screen there is still some problems with the movement of the birds. 

[To Do:]
The goal would be to have all birds flying to one or the other screen when a person is moving from one screen to another. At the moment it is hard to "reach" all the pixels, that makes the outcome hard to read, since some of the pixels are still in the screen where the person is standing in front of and others are already at the screen where they should be. 

[The Start Stage:]
"IMMIGRANTS OUT" on the left screen should be the stage in what it appears on the screen when no one is in front of the camera or standing on the right side of the screens. 

[Details]
I have added images for more clear explanation.
