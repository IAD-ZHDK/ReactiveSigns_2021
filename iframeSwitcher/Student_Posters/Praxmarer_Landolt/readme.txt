GARCE â€“ GRACE

Problems, we couldn't solve:


1. 
---
If no one is standing in front of the poster, it rotates slowly by itself so that the bad word is not always permanently visible and hits you in the face.

-> But column 5 and 6 in screen 3 rotate 180 degrees offset and we don't know why. 
---

2.
---
-> Tracking needs to be more direct, less smooth. When you walk up and down in front of the big screen, the rotation animation of the columns happens a little too late afterwards.



// Luke: I think i have solved the two problems above. Wouldn't it be cool if each cylinder had a random motion so the words are completely mixed up when no is infront?
